%h2 Bundler Code of Conduct

%p The Bundler project strongly values contributors from anywhere, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. As a result, the Bundler team has agreed to and enforces this code of conduct in order to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone who participates in the development of Bundler.

%h3 Summary

%p Harassment in code and discussion or violation of physical boundaries is completely unacceptable anywhere in the Bundler project’s codebases, issue trackers, IRC channel, Campfire, mailing lists, meetups, and other events. Violators will be warned and then blocked or banned by the core team at or before the 3rd violation.

%h3 In detail

%p
  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual attention.
  %br
  %br
  Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
  %br
  %br
  Maintainers, including the core team, are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.
  %br
  %br
  If anyone engages in harassing behavior, including maintainers, we may take appropriate action, up to and including warning the offender, deletion of comments, removal from the project’s codebase and communication systems, and escalation to Github support.
  %br
  %br
  If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a membor of the core team immediately. The core team is listed on the Bundler website contributors page.
  %br
  %br
  We expect everyone to follow these rules anywhere in the Bundler project’s codebases, issue trackers, IRC channel, Campfire, and mailing lists.
  %br
  %br
  Finally, don't forget that it is human to make mistakes! We all do. Let’s work together to help each other, resolve issues, and learn from the mistakes that we will all inevitably make from time to time.
