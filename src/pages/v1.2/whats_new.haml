      In this section, you'll find the major features introduced in the release.

%h2 ruby directive

.contents
  .bullet
    .description
      You can now specify the version of ruby in the <code>Gemfile</code> like the following:
    :highlight_ruby
      ruby "1.9.3"

  .bullet
    .description
      What this means is that this app has a dependency to a ruby vm that is ABI compatible with 1.9.3. If the version check does not match, Bundler will raise an exception. This will ensure the running code matches. You can be more specific with the <code>:engine</code> and <code>:engine_version</code> options.
    :highlight_ruby
      ruby "1.9.3", :engine => "jruby", :engine_version => "1.6.7"

%h2 Package git and path repos

.contents
  .bullet
    .description
      Since Bundler 1.2, the <code>bundle package</code> command can also package <code>:git</code> and
      <code>:path</code> dependencies besides .gem files. This needs to be explicitly enabled
      via the <code>--all</code> option. Once used, the <code>--all</code> option will be remembered.
      This also applies to <code>bundle cache</code>.

%h2 Local Git Repos

.contents
  .bullet
    .description
      Bundler also allows you to work against a git repository locally
      instead of using the remote version. This can be achieved by setting
      up a local override:
    :highlight_plain
      bundle config local.GEM_NAME /path/to/local/git/repository

  .bullet
    .description
      For example, in order to use a local Rack repository, a developer could call:
    :highlight_plain
      bundle config local.rack ~/Work/git/rack

  .bullet
    .description
      %p
        Now instead of checking out the remote git repository, the local
        override will be used. Similar to a path source, every time the local
        git repository change, changes will be automatically picked up by
        Bundler. This means a commit in the local git repo will update the
        revision in the <code>Gemfile.lock</code> to the local git repo revision. This
        requires the same attention as git submodules. Before pushing to
        the remote, you need to ensure the local override was pushed, otherwise
        you may point to a commit that only exists in your local machine.

      %p
        Bundler does many checks to ensure a developer won't work with
        invalid references. Particularly, we force a developer to specify
        a branch in the <code>Gemfile</code> in order to use this feature. If the branch
        specified in the <code>Gemfile</code> and the current branch in the local git
        repository do not match, Bundler will abort. This ensures that
        a developer is always working against the correct branches, and prevents
        accidental locking to a different branch.

      %p
        Finally, Bundler also ensures that the current revision in the
        <code>Gemfile.lock</code> exists in the local git repository. By doing this, Bundler
        forces you to fetch the latest changes in the remotes.
